# Unmind Talk

Welcome to Unmind Talk. The following project is composed of a Go Backend and a React Typescript Frontend, and built with Docker Compose.

# Prerequisites

Clone this repository. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose set up.

In the interview, we'll be walking through a pairing exercise which will require you to run the frontend and backend locally, and weâ€™ll be asking you to make changes to:

- connect up the frontend and backend
- serve data from the backend on the frontend
- make requests from the frontend to the backend to update data

You will be able to use any resources such as Google during the interview.

# Instructions

1. Clone the Repo
2. Build the docker containers using `docker-compose up --build`

Note: It is set up to hot reload.
