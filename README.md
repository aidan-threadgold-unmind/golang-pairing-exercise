# Unmind Golang Pairing Exercise

The following project is composed of a Go backend and a React Typescript frontend, and built with Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Clone this repository. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose set up.

## Pairing exercise

In the pairing exercise, we'll require you to run the backend and frontend locally, and we'll be asking you to make changes to:

- connect up the frontend and backend
- serve data from the backend to the frontend
- make requests from the frontend to the backend to update data

We will be primarily working with the Go backend and only using the React frontend for displaying data and potentially interacting with the Go backend.

You will be able to use any resources such as Google during the pairing exercise.

## Instructions

1. Clone the Repo
2. Build the docker containers using `docker-compose up --build`

Note: It is set up to hot reload.
